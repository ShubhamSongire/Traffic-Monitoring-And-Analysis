# Traffic-Monitoring-And-Analysis

Addressing the daily challenge of traffic management through technology and real-time analysis, this project focuses on road traffic monitoring and analysis using YOLOv7 and DeepSort. The objective is to enhance road safety by developing object detection and tracking models that can be deployed using embedded edge devices with CCTV cameras placed alongside roads.

## Introduction

Road traffic monitoring and analysis play a crucial role in improving road safety and infrastructure planning. This project aims to leverage YOLOv7 and DeepSort to develop eight object detection and tracking models. These models can be deployed on embedded edge devices equipped with CCTV cameras placed alongside roads. By monitoring and analyzing traffic in real-time, these models empower government authorities to issue e-challans to rule violators, collect valuable traffic data for infrastructure development, and make informed decisions to enhance road safety.

## Models

### 1/8) Vehicle Classification and Counting

This model accurately counts vehicles passing through an area, providing valuable data for informed decision-making regarding infrastructure development. It logs vehicle types and timestamps for future analysis. The model supports the following vehicle classes: bus, car, bike, truck, auto, tractor, traveler, LCV.

### 2/8) Speed Detection

This model identifies and tracks vehicles that exceed speed limits.

### 3/8) Helmet Detection

The helmet detection model detects whether a rider is wearing a helmet, enabling authorities to promote road safety and reduce accidents. Images of individuals not wearing helmets are saved in the model's logs.

### 4/8) Reverse Lane Driving Detection

This model identifies vehicles driving in reverse lanes, which can lead to dangerous accidents. It flags such vehicles for attention.

### 5/8) Triple Seat Driving Detection

The triple seat driving detection model detects drivers carrying more than two passengers on a bike.

### 6/8) Fog Detection

The fog detection model, trained with 94% accuracy using a CNN, helps drivers stay safe by identifying foggy areas and alerting them to slow down. Drive safely and remain aware of your surroundings.

### 7/8) Stopped Vehicles

This model detects and notifies traffic authorities about any stopped vehicles on the road, assisting them in taking necessary actions to avoid traffic congestion and accidents.

### 8/8) Number Plate Detection

The number plate detection model identifies traffic rule violators by capturing their number plates and issuing e-challans for traffic fines. It improves traffic safety and ensures compliance with traffic laws.

## Dataset

The models were trained on a labeled dataset comprising 7,443 images. The dataset includes annotations for various use cases.

## Usage

To use the models, follow the instructions in the [GitHub repository](https://lnkd.in/dSK73d-C). Make sure to set up the required dependencies and configuration as mentioned in the repository.
